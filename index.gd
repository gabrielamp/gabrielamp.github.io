Hi there! My name is Gabriela. I'm a final year Mathematics and Computer Science student at McGill University in Montr√©al, Canada.
I am currently a research assistant at the [RL Lab](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca)/[Mila](https://mila.quebec) where I work on abstraction in reinforcement learning.
My interests include foundations of machine learning, probability theory, absract algebra as well as AI for climate change and social good.
