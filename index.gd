My name's Gabriela, and I'm a Mathematics and Computer Science student at McGill University in Montr√©al, Canada.

I enjoy:
* algebra

* cooking
* reading
* drawing
* sleeping 9 hours

S. Elaidi and D. Lopez gave the following definition in their seminal work *On Gabriela Moisescu-Pareja* (2020):

<def-env>
A *Gabriela* is a Human with a grandma-factor \( \gamma \) larger than 1.
We denote this by \(G[\gamma]\).
</def-env>

<thm-env>
A \(G[\gamma]\) satisfies the following properties:
1. \(G[\gamma]\) likes algebra
2. \(G[\gamma] \) sleeps at \( 0:00 - \gamma  \) at night
</thm-env>
